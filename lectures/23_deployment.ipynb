We aim to predict the age of abalone based on eight physical measurements. The data provided in the tutorial has been modified from the original, namely, the \"Sex\" characteristic has been one-hot-encoded and the \"rings\" target variable has had +1.5 added to it to represent the abalone age in years. The data is located in the [data folder](./data). It has been shuffled, one-hot-encoded and split into training and validation sets for you. The training set has 3341 rows and the validation set has 836 rows. The data looks like this:\n",
